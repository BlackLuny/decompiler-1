This is an attempt at a decompiler. The source language is binary/assembly and the
target language will be something high level, at least C but preferably python or
scheme or something.

Initial plan:
  Build these modules.

  disassembler - converts binary code into assembly
    would like to support x86, ppc, and arm but start with x86
  static analysis - learn various features about the assembly program
  decompiler - use these properties to generate high level code

Existing work:
  java decompilers - 
  binary to C decompiler -
